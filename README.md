The project is the game Snake that are usually included in flip phones.

The project is a game that is designed to make the user happy while playing it because of how many apples can you get.

This project requires that you know how to use GUI design. I recommend you go into 2 programming college classes before doing this project to understand it.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu, or search a youtube video on how to do it. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.

I (Ameer) is the only one who maintains this project.
